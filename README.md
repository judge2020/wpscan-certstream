### Wpscan Certstream

This is a python hacky thing to automatically build a list of valid websites with WPscan, then scan each site to test for wordpress vulnerabilities with [WPScan](https://github.com/wpscanteam/wpscan).

#### Usage

To build a list: 

```
python3 main.py
```

To scan the websites:

```
python3 read.py
```

I do have plans to make this better, however this was made during my free time on vacation.
